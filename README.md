# Ahmad Qaraqish â€“ AI & Data Enthusiast

Welcome to my GitHub repository.

I'm Ahmad Qaraqish, a final-year student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis. Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and data-driven problem solving. My passion lies in using technology to build meaningful solutions, especially in areas that combine innovation with social or creative impact.

Beyond the world of code and algorithms, I'm also an artist at heart. I enjoy painting, writing poetry, and exploring the connection between creativity and technology. I believe that true innovation comes when logic meets imagination.

This GitHub space is where I share my work, experiments, and growth as a developer, thinker, and problem-solver.
